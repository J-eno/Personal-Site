Hi! My name is Joel Okpara. I am the CEO and Founder of Joel Okpara. Well, technically, I suppose that my parents were the Founders... and the CEOs of Joel Okpara, but as a grown man, I am now the CEO. They're definitely still on the Board of Directors though.

I started out life far more interested in the arts than the sciences until I started playing online games as a teen. This sparked a desire in me to make games of my own and changed my trajectory for good. I signed up for programming classes in highschool, and earned a degree in Computer Science.\

I now work primarily as a Frontend Developer, while working on apps and games in my free time.
